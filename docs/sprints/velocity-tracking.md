| Sprint 3* | 95% | 98% | TBD | TBD |

### Quality vs Velocity Balance
- **Sprint 1**: Good quality but lower velocity
- **Sprint 2**: Maintained quality while improving velocity
- **Goal**: Continue improving velocity without sacrificing quality

## Risk Factors

### Velocity Risks
1. **Feature Complexity**: Advanced features may require more time
2. **Team Changes**: Potential team member turnover
3. **Technical Debt**: Accumulated debt may slow future development
4. **External Dependencies**: Third-party API limitations

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Gradual Complexity**: Introduce complex features gradually
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Cross-training team members
3. **Regular Refactoring**: Dedicate time to technical debt reduction
4. **Alternative Solutions**: Plan fallback for external dependencies

## Conclusion

The MORSE team shows positive velocity growth trends, improving from 28 to 32 points per developer between Sprint 1 and Sprint 2. This represents a 14% improvement, exceeding the target 10-15% growth rate. The team is becoming more efficient while maintaining code quality and project momentum.

Key insights:
- Velocity improvement is sustainable with proper estimation
- 20% buffer is appropriate for this project type
- Quality metrics are improving alongside velocity
- Team collaboration is a key success factor

Projections for future sprints suggest continued growth while maintaining quality standards, with a target of 35-40 points per developer by Sprint 4-5.
