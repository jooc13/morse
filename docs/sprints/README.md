## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive sprint documentation for the MORSE project - an innovative voice-powered workout tracker that uses AI-powered audio transcription to automatically log gym sessions.

## Sprint Process

### Sprint Cycle
- **Duration**: 2-week sprints (10 working days)
- **Planning**: First day of sprint, 2-hour session
- **Daily Stand-ups**: 15-minute daily check-ins at 9:00 AM
- **Review**: Last day of sprint, 1-hour demo session
- **Retrospective**: Last day of sprint, 1-hour reflection session

### Team Structure
- **Product Owner**: oversees product vision and priorities
- **Scrum Master**: facilitates process and removes impediments
- **Development Team** (4 members): engineers, designers, QA
- **Total Capacity**: ~80 points per sprint (2 developers × 40 points each)

### Velocity and Planning
- **Initial Velocity**: 25-30 points for Sprint 1
- **Velocity Growth**: Target 10-15% increase per sprint
